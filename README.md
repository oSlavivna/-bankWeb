ğŸŒŸ Excited to share my latest project â€” a modern bank website! ğŸŒŸ

Here are some key features:

ğŸ”¹ **Modal window** for displaying important information and interactions.

ğŸ”¹ **Event delegation** for navigation and operation buttons, enhancing efficiency and ease of use.

ğŸ”¹ **Lazy loading** for image optimization, speeding up the site.

ğŸ”¹ **Sticky navbar** for convenient access to the menu during scrolling.

ğŸ”¹ **Smooth scrolling** for a comfortable user experience.

ğŸ”¹ **Intersection Observer API** for a smooth reveal of new sections as you scroll.

ğŸ”¹ **Slider** that responds to arrows, dots, and buttons for intuitive navigation.

This project allowed me to utilize modern web technologies and refine my skills in creating functional and user-friendly websites. ğŸš€
